(by William Shakespeare)

From naked stones of agony

I will build a house for me;

As a mason all alone

I will raise it, stone by stone,

And every stone where I have bled

Will show a sign of dusky red.

I have not gone the way in vain,

For I have good of all my pain;

My spirit's quiet house will be

Built of naked stones I trod

On roads where I lost sight of God.
